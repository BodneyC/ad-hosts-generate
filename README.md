Ad Hosts Generate
=================

Generate a `/etc/hosts` file based on a few ad-listing resources, see the `_get_hosts` function for details.

This is pretty much based on [host-gen](https://surf.suckless.org/files/adblock-hosts/) by [Suckless](https://suckless.org/) but I found the implementation lacking and overly complex - this is a slightly simpler 'all-in-one' approach.
